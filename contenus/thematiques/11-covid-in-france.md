.. question:: Why do I need to wear a face mask if I am vaccinated against Covid-19?

   Covid vaccines are **highly effective** at keeping you from developing **serious forms** of the illness. Although they also significantly reduce the risk of getting and spreading Covid-19, they are — just as any other vaccine — not 100% effective. This is why, in France, vaccinated people must still wear face masks in certain areas (mainly indoors) in order to **protect others**.

.. question:: Does the vaccine prevent me from getting Covid-19?

   The vaccines significantly reduce the risks of experiencing a severe case of Covid-19, and spreading it.
   However, as any other vaccine, it is not a 100% effective.

   If you experience Covid-19 symptoms, or if your Covid test result is positive, we encourage you to **self-isolate for 10 days**, in order to protect the vulnerable people around you.

   You should also tell your close contacts that they may have been exposed to the virus and they should get tested immediately.

.. question:: As a foreigner, tourist or student, vaccinated outside the European Union, how can I obtain a French health pass (<i>pass sanitaire</i>)?

   * Foreign **students** studying in France can [request the conversion](https://www.demarches-simplifiees.fr/commencer/passe-sanitaire-etudiants?locale=en) of their vaccine certificate.

   * Non-european **tourists** visiting France should send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:help.covid-pass@diplomatie.gouv.fr">help.covid-pass@diplomatie.gouv.fr</a> for assistance.

.. question:: Which means of transport require the health pass (<i>pass sanitaire</i>)?

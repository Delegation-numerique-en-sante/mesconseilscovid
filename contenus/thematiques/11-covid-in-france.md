.. question:: Why do I need to wear a face mask if I am vaccinated against Covid-19?

   Covid vaccines are **highly effective** at keeping you from developing **serious forms** of the illness. Although they also significantly reduce the risk of getting and spreading Covid-19, they are — just as any other vaccine — not 100% effective. This is why, in France, vaccinated people must still wear face masks in certain areas (mainly indoors) in order to **protect others**.


.. question:: Does the vaccine prevent me from getting Covid-19?

   The vaccines significantly reduce the risks of experiencing a severe case of Covid-19, and spreading it.
   However, as any other vaccine, it is not 100% effective.

   If you experience Covid-19 symptoms, or if your Covid test result is positive, we encourage you to **self-isolate for 10 days**, in order to protect the vulnerable people around you.

   You should also tell your close contacts that they may have been exposed to the virus and they should get tested immediately.
